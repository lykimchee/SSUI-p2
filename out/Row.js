// A row layout class designed to work with springs and struts layout.
// To use this class children in the row should be separated by Spring
// and Strut objects.  Springs will stretch and compress, struts are fixed
// length, neither produces any output (except in there *_debug versions,
// which are useful for understanding how they work).  
// 
// This object must be given a width either by its parent during layout, 
// or simply in advance when the parent isn't doing layout (e.g., when the 
// parent is a Group, TopObject, DrawnObjectBase, etc.).  It's height will
// automatically be set to a fixed size which matches the maximum natural size
// among it's children.
//
// Children are sized in width using springs and struts layout rules.  In height
// they are set to their natural size.  Children are positioned to be stacked
// horizontall.  Vertically they are top, center, or bottom justified
// (as controlled by the hJustification property of this object).
